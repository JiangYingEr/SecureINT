# SecureINT

SecureINT is a security-enhanced INT (In-band Network Telemetry) prototype that provides ***encryption*** and ***integrity verification*** for INT metadata. Programmable switches use Even-Mansour to encrypt INT metadata and SipHash to generate hash values. SecureINT is proposed to defend against In-band Network Telemetry Manipulation Attacks. For more details about these novel attacks and SecureINT, please refer to our paper: [In-band Network Telemetry Manipulation Attacks and Countermeasures in Programmable Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188809) (published in IWQoS 2023).
