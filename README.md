# SecureINT

SecureINT is a security-enhanced INT (In-band Network Telemetry) prototype that offers ***encryption*** and ***integrity verification*** for INT metadata. It uses Even-Mansour for encryption and SipHash for integrity verification.
The encryption and integrity verification is achieved by programmable switches, each of which has independent security keys.
